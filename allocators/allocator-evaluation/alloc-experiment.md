### What is the Problem?

The performance of memory allocation operations is a very important aspect to be considered in software design, however it is frequently neglected. Few works evaluates user-level memory allocators (UMA) with real-world multithreaded applications.

### Summary

This paper presents an experimental comparative study of seven largely adopted memory allocators, comparing the applications' response time, memory consumption, and memory fragmentation, with respect to their statistical significance throughout the ANOVA method.
